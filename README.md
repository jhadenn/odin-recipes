Project 1 of The Odin Project 2025-09-11

So far, I already know basic HTML and CSS from freecodecamp.com, but I feel as if I haven't really learned or done anything real yet. My goal this year is to finish the odin project and be confident in my skills so that I can get rid of imposter syndrome and become who I think I am.
